        "### Analyzing Common Failure Patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "Even with high accuracy, LLM-based extraction can produce errors that reveal common challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Over-extraction:** The model extracts technically correct but contextually excessive information (e.g., including a company's former name). This pattern often requires stricter output formatting rules or more sophisticated post-processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Ambiguous Layout:** The model incorrectly identifies a field because the document layout contains multiple plausible candidates (e.g., extracting a \"payment due\" amount instead of the \"invoice total\"). This class of errors is often best handled by implementing confidence scores to flag ambiguous cases for human review.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address these failure patterns, you can implement **confidence scoring** to automatically flag ambiguous layouts for human review—a critical step for high-value transactions. For issues like over-extraction, you can refine your prompts with more specific formatting instructions or provide **few-shot examples** to guide the model toward the desired output structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "These failure patterns underscore that the goal is not to eliminate human involvement, but to augment it. A successful system reliably handles the majority of invoices, while intelligently flagging complex exceptions for AP specialists to review, allowing them to focus on high-value decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next steps and upgrade paths\n",
        "\n",
        "You've built an invoice processing system that combines Llama's multimodal capabilities to handle real-world document complexity. The two-stage architecture provides a flexible foundation that can be adapted to various industries and scale requirements. Here's how to extend this system for specific business needs and scale requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "| Invoice Type | Recommended Approach | Why |\n",
        "|:------------|:--------------------|:----|\n",
        "| **Simple receipts** (< 10 items) | Stage 1 only | Multimodal extraction suffices for straightforward layouts |\n",
        "| **Complex invoices** (multiple currencies) | Both stages | Stage 2 enrichment adds critical currency normalization |\n",
        "| **High-value transactions** (> $10K) | Both stages + confidence scoring | Add verification techniques for risk mitigation |\n",
        "| **Batch processing** (> 100/day) | Adaptive routing | Use confidence thresholds to route only ambiguous cases to Stage 2 |\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expanding with production tools\n",
        "\n",
        "While this tutorial uses currency conversion to demonstrate tool calling, production systems typically integrate high-impact business tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Vendor Validation**: `validate_vendor` checks vendors against approved supplier databases, reducing fraud risk and ensuring compliance with procurement policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Duplicate Detection**: `duplicate_detection` prevents double payments by comparing invoice amounts, dates, and vendor details against recent payment history.\n",

        "**Budget Approval**: `check_budget_approval` verifies purchases against approved budgets and spending limits, enabling automated approval workflows for compliant transactions.\n",
        "\n",
