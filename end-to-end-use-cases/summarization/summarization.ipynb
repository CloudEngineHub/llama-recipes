    "## Step 2: The logic of chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Chunk?\n",
    "\n",
    "For long documents, even with a large context window, summarizing in a single pass can lead to context degradation, where the model may under-weigh details from the middle of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure all parts of the document are processed with equal focus, we use a **map-reduce** approach. Breaking the document into smaller, coherent chunks for individual summarization guarantees a more detailed and high-quality final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to chunk?\n",
    "\n",
    "An effective chunking strategy is critical. Simply splitting the text by a fixed token count can break sentences or separate related ideas. A better approach is **semantic chunking**. Our strategy has two levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Header-based splitting:** First, the document is split into large sections based on its markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`). This preserves the document's logical structure.\n",
    "2.  **Paragraph-based Chunking:** Each large section is then divided into the final, smaller chunks. This process respects paragraph boundaries and a specified token limit, ensuring the chunks are both semantically coherent and sized appropriately for the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note on Generalization:** This tutorial's header-based splitting is optimized for markdown documents. For other formats (like plain text or PDFs), you can generalize this header-based splitting approach by identifying similar structural elements. For instance, you could split by chapter titles, numbered sections, or use regular expressions to find custom patterns that define logical breaks in your document. The principle of multi-level semantic chunking remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Chunk Size\n",
    "\n",
    "While our chunking strategy prioritizes semantic boundaries (headers and paragraphs) over fixed token counts, we still need to set a maximum size for our chunks. This ensures that even the largest semantic chunk fits comfortably within the model's context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CHUNK_SIZE_TOKENS` constant serves as this upper limit. Finding the right value is a trade-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Set Too High:** The limit might still be larger than the model's context window (once the prompt is included), causing API calls to fail.\n",
    "*   **Set Too Low:** This could force the chunking logic to split paragraphs or other logical units too aggressively, reducing the quality of the summaries. It also increases the number of API calls, leading to higher cost and latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `16000` token limit in this tutorial is a conservative size for models with large context windows (usually 128k for models available on the Llama API). It leaves ample room for the prompt while ensuring each chunk is large enough to provide meaningful context for summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note on Local Processing:** All processing up to this point, including loading the data and chunking the text, happens locally. We have not yet made any calls to the Llama API. The token counting is done with a local library to ensure our chunks are the right size for the API calls in the next steps."

      "We introduce Astro, the \"Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner\", a framework for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs. Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful, build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama 3. Astro teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries from failure, Astro bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply Astro to the Llama 3 family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon challenging problems that require iterative correction.

      "Training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) has greatly improved their reasoning capabilities, leading to the advent of reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024), DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) or Gemini 2.5 (Google, 2025). A prominent feature of reasoning models is their ability to iteratively refine their outputs with a behavior similar to search – a process which involves reflecting on their own outputs and backtracking to a previous state (Xiang et al., 2025). While open-source replications of reasoning models achieve notable performance improvements, they rely on distillation from existing reasoning\n",

      "Figure 2 An overview of Astro. Given a math reasoning problem, we first perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in a stepwise manner with verifiable rewards and obtain a search tree where each node contains a discrete reasoning step with its associated Q-value. We then linearize the visited sequence of nodes, including intermediate nodes with incorrect answers, into a solution that integrates backtracking and self-reflection in natural language. Then, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the search-integrated solutions and bootstrap our policy to perform autoregressive search. Finally, we further improve the policy's search and reasoning capabilities with reinforcement learning (RL).\n",

      "models (Li et al., 2025; Muennighoff et al., 2025) or direct RL (Hu et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025) from LLMs that (1) already contain reflective behavior and strong reasoning capabilities (Chang et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025), and (2) exhibit spurious performance gains from incorrect or noisy reward signals during RL (Lv et al., 2025; Shao et al., 2025). Hence it is unclear from a scientific perspective how reasoning models can be built from other LLMs that do not exhibit the aforementioned behavior, such as Llama 3 (AI at Meta, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "We introduce ASTRO, the \"Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner\", a framework that systematically infuses search-like behavior into language models ab initio to improve their reasoning capabilities. The fundamental principle guiding Astro is search, where our policy explores the solution space by selecting actions, reflecting on its own solution, and backtracking to a previous step if needed. Astro trains language models to perform autoregressive search – instead of using external search scaffolds such as beam search to solve reasoning problems, Astro internalizes the search procedure and generates entire search trajectories, including reflections and backtracks, in a single inference pass. Models trained using Astro exhibit improved reasoning abilities by frequently re-evaluating their solutions and backtracking until they reach a final answer of high confidence. Moreover, such models generate structured reasoning traces that can be mapped to a directed graph with each vertex representing a discrete reasoning step, allowing for a richer understanding of their reasoning processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Astro operates in three stages: (1) search trajectory generation, (2) supervised fine-tuning and (3) reinforcement learning. We initially bootstrap our models with search behavior by generating search trajectories to be used for training data via procedure cloning (Yang et al., 2022; Laskin et al., 2022) – we perform search with custom scaffolding over our language model policy to explore over different solution trajectories for each math problem, and we train our policy without using scaffolds at test time to predict the entire sequence of actions, including intermediate actions that lead to incorrect answers, that ultimately end with a successful terminal state. Then, we further optimize our policy via RL to improve their reasoning and search capabilities. Astro provides beneficial priors for RL during its data generation stage by systematically injecting self-reflection and backtracking patterns to the search traces via procedure cloning.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we generate synthetic data, also called the cold-start data (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Qwen, 2025), to instill autoregressive search priors to our models. To this end, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore the solution space of challenging math problems and build search trees with diverse reasoning traces. We linearize each search tree into a sequence of nodes visited during the search process, which we then convert into a natural language chain-of-thought (CoT, Wei et al. (2022)) that integrates self-reflection and backtracking. Then, we sample about 36K high-quality CoT solutions across three open-source math datasets.\n",

Here we assume that ΠLM solves math problems in a stepwise manner, where each step st represents a sequence of tokens y1 · · · y|st| encapsulating a minimal unit of reasoning required to solve x. Then, each state St represents a combination of the input prompt and the sequence of steps generated by the policy, i.e. St = (x, s0, · · · , st). Meanwhile, the action at+1 represents the next step st+1 taken by ΠLM to address x. Refer to Figure 3 for examples of the steps defined in our setup.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. For each x we generate a search tree T, where each node ni represents the state Si and each edge (ni, nj) represents the action aj, i.e. the next step sj taken from Si to Sj, using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore the solution space based on verifier-based rewards from rollouts (Section 2.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. We linearize T into a sequence of nodes L = (n0, · · · , nend), a subsequence of the entire history of nodes visited by ΠLM until arriving at nend, the terminal node with the correct answer. Some adjacent pairs of nodes (nt, nt+1) in L are such that nt+1 is an ancestor of nt in T, which corresponds to self-reflection and backtracking during the search procedure (Section 2.3).\n",

    "\n",
    "You run the same map-reduce process again on the chunk summaries themselves:\n",
    "1.  Generate 500 chunk summaries from the original document.\n",
    "2.  Group these 500 summaries into batches of 50.\n",
    "3.  Run your `reduce_create_final_summary` function on each batch, producing 10 \"super summaries\".\n",

    "| **More advanced chunking**     | For more robust document splitting, explore libraries such as LangChain or LlamaIndex, which offer \"Recursive Character Text Splitters\" that can handle complex documents and code. These can split based on code syntax, markdown structure, and more. |\n",
    "| **Alternative patterns**       | The \"Map-Reduce\" pattern is not the only option. Learn about the **\"Refine\" pattern**, where the model iteratively builds upon and refines a summary by processing one chunk at a time. This can be better for creating a single, highly coherent narrative. |\n",
    "| **Question & Answering**       | If your goal is to ask questions of a long document instead of summarizing it, the best approach is **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. This involves storing chunks in a vector database and retrieving only the most relevant ones to answer a user's question. See our [Contextual chunking RAG recipe](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/end-to-end-use-cases/Contextual-Chunking-RAG). |\n"
