    "\n",
    "While traditional documentation tools require manual annotation or simple extraction, this approach uses Llama 4's large context window and code understanding capabilities to generate meaningful, contextual documentation that explains not just what the code does, but how components work together.\n",

Common examples include [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-meta.html) and [Together AI](https://together.ai/llama). The core logic of this tutorial can be adapted to any of these providers."

    "## Problem: Documentation debt\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation debt is a persistent challenge in software development. As codebases evolve, manual documentation efforts often fall behind, leading to outdated, inconsistent, or missing information. This slows down developer onboarding and makes maintenance more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution: An automated documentation pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial's solution is a multi-stage pipeline that systematically analyzes a repository to produce a comprehensive `README.md` file. The system works by progressively analyzing your repository in multiple stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart LR\n",
    "    A[GitHub Repo] --> B[Step 1: File Analysis]\n",
    "    B --> C[Step 2: <br> Repository Overview]\n",
    "    C --> D[Step 3: <br> Architecture Analysis]\n",
    "    D --> E[Step 4: Final README]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By breaking down the complex task of repository analysis into manageable stages, you can process repositories of any size efficiently. The large context window of Llama 4 Scout is sufficient to analyze entire source files without complex chunking strategies, resulting in high-quality documentation that captures both fine-grained details and architectural patterns."

The model is prompted to select files that represent the core logic, primary entry points, or key data structures, based on the summaries generated earlier. This step efficiently filters the codebase down to its most critical components.\n",
    "2.  **Deep-dive analysis**: With the key files identified, you perform a much deeper analysis. While only the full source code of these selected files is provided, the model also receives the summaries of *all* files generated in the first step. This ensures it has broad, high-level context on the entire repository when it performs its deep analysis.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  The Llama class takes in a prompt or a dialog and tokenizes it using the Tokenizer class.\n",
      "2.  The tokenized prompt or dialog is then passed to the Transformer class, which outputs logits.\n",
